# PS<sup>2</sup>MS

Repository for NYCU JHHLab NPS detection project. 

The repository for the paper ["PS<sup>2</sup>MS"](): A Deep Learning-Based Prediction System for Detecting Novel New Psychoactive Substances Using Mass Spectrometry.

## Informations

PS<sup>2</sup>MS is designed specifically to address the limitations of identifying the emergence of unidentified novel illicit drugs. 
PS<sup>2</sup>MS builds a synthetic NPS database by enumerating possible derivatives based on the core structure of a preselected illicit drug.
The system leverages two deep learning tools, NEIMS and DeepEI, to generate mass spectra and chemical fingerprints, respectively.
Finally, PS<sup>2</sup>MS calculates the integrated similarity scores(SMSF) between the unknown analyte and the derivatives from synthetic database and yields a list of potential NPS identities for the analyte.


## Requirement

- GNU [g++-10](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/) or higher
- [CMake 3.16.0](https://cmake.org/download/) or higher to build the enumeration step and the detection step
- [python 3.6.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher to the run deep learing tools
- [rdkit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)

## DeepEI
- PS<sup>2</sup>MS employs DeepEI to predict the fingerprint of the unknown analyte.

### Usage:

#### Install conda env 
```bash
conda env create --name deepei -f DeepEI/environment.yml
```

#### Run prediction
```bash
cd DeepEI
conda activate deepei

python predict.py --help
```

#### Combine the mass spectrum and fingerprint
```bash
python3 merge_fp_into_msp.py \
  ${MS.msp} \
  ${FP.pkl} \
  ${result.msp}
```


## Drug detection
- The final step of PS<sup>2</sup>MS to compare the analyte and the synthetic database
- We utilize the data type from the [cfm-id-code](https://bitbucket.org/wishartlab/cfm-id-code/src/master/cfm/) project

### Usage

#### Build project
Follow the step in INSTALL.txt

#### Run detection
* Condition 1: The analytes are known.
  * `database_file`: The file contains the mass spectrum and the fingerprint of enumerated compounds and is in msp format.
  * `test_file`: The file contains the mass spectrum and the fingerprint of the analytes and is in msp format.
  * `result.txt`: The file records the ranking performance of every analyte. For every analyte, the first line is the rank and the SMSF score of the answer in enumerate database. The following lines are the SMILES and SMSF score of molecular which has higher rank than the answer in enumerate database.
  * `scores.txt`: The file records the similarity scores of every analyte. For an analyte, it records the cosine similarity of mass spectrum, the Jaccard similarity of mass spectrum, the similarity of fingerprint and the SMSF score of with the corresponding one in enumerate database.
  * `restrict_mw`: A boolean value. If true, the system will solely compute the similarity for compounds whose molecular weight falls within the range of the analyte's molecular weight plus or minus one..
  * `top_n_of_JS_of_MS`: A positive integer. This value determines the number of the highest peaks used to compute the Jaccard similarity of mass spectra between two compounds. If set to zero, the system will not calculate the Jaccard similarity of mass sepctrum.
```bash
./build/drug-comparation/cfm_comparation \
  ${database_file} \
  ${test_file} \
  ${result.txt} \
  ${scores.txt} \
  ${restrict_mw} ${top_n_of_JS_of_MS}
```

* Condition 2: The analytes are unknown.
  * `database_file`: The file contains the mass spectrum and the fingerprint of enumerated compounds and is in msp format.
  * `test_file`: The file contains the mass spectrum and the fingerprint of the analytes and is in msp format.
  * `result.txt`: The file records the result of every analyte. For every analyte, the top 100 compounds is recorded with the SMILES and SMSF score.
  * `restrict_mw`: A boolean value. If true, the system will solely compute the similarity for compounds whose molecular weight falls within the range of the analyte's molecular weight plus or minus one..
  * `top_n_of_JS_of_MS`: A positive integer. This value determines the number of the highest peaks used to compute the Jaccard similarity of mass spectra between two compounds. If set to zero, the system will not calculate the Jaccard similarity of mass sepctrum.
